    Welcome to Nelson's Merch!
  In this project, I wanted to create a simple view clothing ecommerces merchant. 
  You will find a Navbar, a image carousel, customer testimonials, a geolocator, and a review/contact submission form. 
  In its simplicity, its purpose is to offer an online service to individuals who shop online. 
  Technologies used are .html and .css
